Microsoft Network Monitor Expert Installer Generator
----------------------------------------------------

This script creates a Windows Installer package (msi) for deploying 'expert' 
add-ons to Microsoft Network Monitor.  For detailed help on expert installer
packages, see http://

This script requires the WIX 2.0 toolset files.  These can be downloaded from 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=105970&package_id=114109

Note:  WIX requires .Net 2.0 or greater.

This script also requires Perl.  perl.exe must be on the default PATH.
You can down your favorite version from http://www.perl.org/get.html

The arguments for this script can be passed on the command line or specified in
an input file.  When using an input file, place each argument on a separate line
without the '-'. Do not surround values with quotes in the input file.  Input files
are useful unless you enjoy typing long command lines.

i.e.
	TargetFile=Expert.msi
	Manufacturer=Microsoft Corporation

Some of the arguments take GUIDs as values.  You can generate GUIDs from
http://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx

All GUIDS used by this script must be in the form ????????-????-????-????-????????????

usage: CreateExpertInstaller inputFile | arg1 arg2 ...

(Required)

	-ExpertName string
		Friendly name of your expert.  i.e. "The Greatest Expert Ever"
	
	-Manufacturer string
		Person or company that produced the expert.
	
	-ExpertVersion MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD.REVISION
		Long version number of the expert.  i.e. 1.0.123.1
	
	-UPGRADECODE guid
		Identifer GUID value for your expert. 

		You should use the same value for future versions of your expert.  That way, 
		Windows will automatically upgrade any existing version of the expert that 
		the user might have on their system.

	-PlatformID x86 | amd64 | ia64
		Processor that the expert was built for.
		You must create separate installers for each platform.  

	-BinaryPath path
		Directory where the files to be installed by the package reside.  The entire
		contents of the directory, including child directories, will be included.

		*** DO NOT INCLUDE ANY FILES INSTALLED BY NETMON (like nmapi.dll) *** 

		The installer will use "%PROGRAMFILES%\Netmon Experts\ExpertName ExpertVersion"
		as the default location on the target machine for the expert files.

		*** This location can be changed by the end user during install ***

    	  	You should avoid depending on a hard-coded path in your expert.

		To reference the actual location, use [INSTALLDIR].  This will be replaced with 
		whatever location the user chose when they installed the package.  You can use this
		token in the ExpertCommandLineArgs, ExpertWorkingDirectory, or ExpertHelpFile
		arguments.

		i.e  ExpertHelpFile can bet set to "[INSTALLDIR]\doc\expert.chm" assuming there is a 
		doc sub-directory under BinaryPath.

	-ExpertCommand string
		The command to invoke the expert.  Do not include any parameters.  
		This is usually the main executeable.  

		i.e. expert.exe
		
(optional)

	-TargetFile filename
		Name of the msi package to generate.  This can be a filename or
		a fully qualified path to a file (recommended).
		Existing files will be over-written

		The default is %TEMP%\expert.msi

	-ExpertCommandLineArgs string
		Arguments to pass to the ExpertCommand.  
		See http:// 
		for a list of special strings that Netmon will substitue values for.

	-ExpertDontEscapeFilterArgs
		If specified, the command line arguments, {NetmonConversationFilter} and {NetmonDisplayFilter}, passed
		to the expert will not include escaped double quotes and backslashes immediately preceding double quotes.

	-ExpertWorkingDirectory path
		Location on the user's machine that should be used as the default 
		working directory for the ExpertCommand.  

		The default value is [INSTALLDIR]		

	-ExpertHelpFile filename
		Name of the help file for the expert.  This is usually a path relative to 
		where the expert was installed.  

		i.e. [INSTALLDIR]\expert.chm
		
		You must ensure that the file extension will be handled by Windows.

	-UpdatePath 
		If specified, the installer will append the location where the expert was installed
		on the user's machine to the PATH environment variable.

		To use this argument in a settings file, supply "true" as the value.

	-TargetNetmonVersion MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD.REVISION | any
		Specific version of Netmon that the expert works with.
		Use 'any' if it does not matter.

		The default value is "any"

	-WixToolPath path
		location of the WIX tools; candle.exe, light.exe, and supporting files.  
		You can omit this setting if the files are on the default path.

	-SetupSourcePath path
		Location of the files required by this script.  

		The default value is the same folder that this script is located in.  

	-PRODUCTID guid
		Optional identifer GUID value for the installer product.  
		If this is not provided, one will be generated for you.

	-PACKAGEID guid
		Optional identifer GUID value for the installer package.  
		If this is not provided, one will be generated for you.

	-GuidGenerator {command line}
		Fully qualified command line for a script or process that will return a new GUID to STDOUT.
		If this option is not set, the user will be prompted for a new GUID each time one is needed 
		by the script during execution.

		Note:
		WIX 2.0 supports automatic generation of GUIDS for Products and Packages but not for Components.
		The installer requires Components to be used for registry settings and each directory installed
		by the experts.  Failure to provide a unique GUID can lead to conflicts between other experts and
		different versions of the same expert.
